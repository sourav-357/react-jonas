# React – Jonas Schmedtmann Course (My Learning Repository)

This repository contains all of my code, exercises, notes, and project implementations while following **Jonas Schmedtmann’s Ultimate React Course**.  
The goal of this repo is to **build a deep, practical understanding of modern React**, improve code quality, and develop production-style habits.

I will update this repository regularly as I move through each section.

## 🎯 My Learning Goals

- Build a **strong foundation** in JSX, components, props, and state.
- Master **Hooks**, state management patterns, and side-effects.
- Understand **React Router**, navigation flow, loaders, actions.
- Use **APIs**, async workflows, and error boundaries properly.
- Learn **Redux** + Redux Toolkit (modern recommended patterns).
- Build production-level apps with **React Query**, **Supabase**, **Tailwind**, and **React Hook Form**.
- Understand the **Next.js App Router**, server components, and deployments.
- Develop a clean coding style with reusable, readable components.

## 📝 Notes

This is a **learning repository**, so you may find:
- multiple versions of the same component (before/after refactor)
- comments explaining tricky parts
- debugging attempts
- personal improvements beyond the video

Everything here is written by me while studying, not copied from final solutions.

## 🎯 Final Goal

By the end of this repo, I aim to have:
- A complete understanding of modern React
- Multiple deployed, resume-worthy projects
- Clean and structured coding habits
- Strong preparation for **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **full-stack apps**
